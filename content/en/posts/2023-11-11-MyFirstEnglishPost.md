DNA-modified nanoparticles enable DNA sensing and therapeutics in nanomedicine and are also crucial for nanoparticle self-assembly with DNA-based materials. <br>
However, methods to conjugate DNA to nanoparticle surfaces are limited, inefficient, and lack control.

Inspired by DNA tile nanotechnology, we demonstrate a new approach to nanoparticl modification based on electrostatic attraction between negatively charged DNA tiles and positively charged nonoparticles.
