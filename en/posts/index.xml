However, methods to conjugate DNA to nanoparticle surfaces are limited, inefficient, and lack control.
Inspired by DNA tile nanotechnology, we demonstrate a new approach to nanoparticl modification based on electrostatic attraction between negatively charged DNA tiles and positively charged nonoparticles.

And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
